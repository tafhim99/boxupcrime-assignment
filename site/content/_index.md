  heading: Our Founder
  text: >-
    Inspired in 2012 from the loss of valued friends due to gang affiliation and
    crime, Stephen Addison launched the project ‘Box Up Crime’ in 2013, a new
    initiative which provides social change though social innovation. We use
    sports, in particular boxing, as a tool to inspire, educate and develop
    young individuals, specifically those who have been involved in crime.
